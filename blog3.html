                Over the past few decades, the sports sector in India has gone through a massive transition by evolving
                from being a country predominantly dedicated to following Cricket to becoming a multi-sport country.
                Sports like Football, Badminton, Basketball, etc. are changing the face of the Indian Sports Industry
                and have gained sizable interest from the people and young sportspeople alike. Among these, Tennis is a
                sport that has carved its niche and is thriving in all respects.
                <br>
                <p>
                    Origins of Tennis in India date back to the time of British colonialism. Tennis had been a popular
                    sport in England since the late 1800s, and the British Army and Civilian Officers brought the game
                    to India. Although it was initially limited to the elite class of the time, Tennis started gaining
                    popularity due to the emergence of Punjab Lawn tennis Championship, Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship,
                    All India Tennis Championships, etc. In their early days, these tournaments were majorly won by
                    Britishers; however, later, Indians started playing the game and brought their nuances to the game
                    with even more significant distinction. After independence, Tennis in India gained traction with
                    players like Ramanathan Krishnan and Premjit Lal.
                    <br>
                    In 1920, the All India Tennis Association (AITA), the governing body of Tennis in India, was
                    established and affiliated by the International Tennis Federation and Asian Tennis Federation. The
                    All India Tennis Association operates all of the Indian national representative tennis sides,
                    including the India Davis Cup team, the India Fed Cup team, etc. It is solely responsible for
                    organizing and hosting tennis tournaments within India and scheduling the international home
                    fixtures.
                    <br>
                    According to the All India Tennis Association, in Davis Cup ties between 1921 and 1929, India won
                    against several countries like France, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Romania, and Holland. Some of the top
                    Indian players like Saleem, Fayzee brothers, Cotah Ramaswamy and Krishna Prasad, won against a large
                    number of ranked European players and teams. However, it was during the 1960s when Tennis in India
                    experienced the golden era.
                    <br>
                    Ramanathan Krishnan, a record six-time All India Championships winner, earned his highest seeding
                    i.e., No. 4 in Wimbledon in 1962. Also, in the Davis Cup, India continually became the Zonal
                    Champions. Ramanathan Krishnan, along with Premjit Lal, SP Misra, Jaidip, and RK Khanna, led India
                    to the Cup finals in 1966. They eventually lost the Cup but not before Krishnan and J Mukerjea beat
                    Newcombe and Tony Roche, the Wimbledon champions, (1965) in doubles. Such Accomplishments motivated
                    and ushered the next generation of athletes towards contributing to the sport of Tennis.
                    <br>
                <h1>Indian Tennis after retirement of Ramanathan Krishnan</h1>
                After Ramanathan Krishnan retired from the sport in 1968, Vijay Amritraj, who was then 17 years old,
                emerged as one of the most prominent players in Indian Tennis. With teammates Sashi Menon, Jasjit Singh,
                and elder brother Anand Amritraj, he led India to World Cup Finals for the second time in 1974. He also
                made it to the quarterfinals of US Open in 1973 and 1981; and Wimbledon in 1973 and 1974. Vijay Amritraj
                also defeated three-time Wimbledon winner John McEnroe at the Cincinnati Masters in 1984, while giving
                tough fights to the likes of Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg at Wimbledon. Alongside, Ramesh Krishnan, the son
                of Ramanathan Krishnan, won the junior Wimbledon championship and junior French Open title in 1979. He
                was ranked number 1 junior in the world and made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (1986) and US Open
                (twice).
                <br>
                The 1990s was when Indian Tennis underwent a phase of evolution with the rise of Leander Paes and Mahesh
                Bhupati. Leander Paes won the bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics, and Mahesh Bhupati became
                India’s first-ever grand slam winner when he won the mixed doubles at French Open in 1997. Both
                partnered with each other and reached the finals of all four grand slams in 1999, winning two. In the
                2000s and 2010s, playing either separately or together, Paes and Bhupati won several grand slam doubles
                and mixed doubles tournaments. They enjoyed a phenomenal 24-match unbeaten run in Davis Cup ties between
                1995-2010. They also participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where they lost to eventual gold
                medallists Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland.
                <br>
                <h1>Tennis in the early 2000's</h1>
                During the 2000s, Sania Mirza became the first Indian to win a WTA tournament. She also gained
                popularity with notable performances in the International Tennis Federation’s junior circuit. She won
                Wimbledon as well as the US Open in 2015, partnering with Swiss star Martina Hingis in the women’s
                doubles category. Another prominent name in the current leading Indian Tennis players is Rohan Bopanna.
                He has ranked as No.3 in the world and been an Olympic, Davis Cup, and Hopman Cup team member. Rohan won
                the 2017 French Open Mixed Doubles title, 16 ATP Tour doubles titles, and has been consistently ranked
                within the Top 15. He also achieved Grand Slam success in 2017 as a mixed doubles player.
                <br>

                School, in association with Rohan Bopanna Tennis Academy (RBTA), strives to bring a new dimension to

                <h1>Influence of tennis in India</h1>
                Tennis in India has a very high following, especially in urban areas. The media’s availability and
                coverage of various National and International Tennis matches and tournaments over digital platforms and
                coverage have increased manifolds because of the massive demand for curiosity among the people around
